Lab 9

Goals

Setup node-exporter on 2 GCP micro instances
Setup prometheus on one of the 2 GCP micro instances
Setup grafana on the same micro instance you setup prometheus
On both GCP instances
Create grader account
Install updates
Install packages
vim, curl, git, fortune, man
Add my SSH public key to grader account
Insult users who mistype sudo password
Adding grader account to sudoer file
Details

You should create two micro-instances on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Each of these should have node-exporter configured as a service. You should also do many of the lab 1 & 2 configurations as mentioned in the goals to both instances.

Choose one instance to be your Prometheus/Grafana instance and setup both as services on this instance, to pull data from both GCP instances. You may need to configure the GCP firewall to allow internal access so that this node can poll the node-exporter on the other instance.

Answer Questions about GCP

Answer the following questions in A9_README.md file in your submission folder.

What is GCP?
